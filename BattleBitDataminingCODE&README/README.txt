"BattleBitRemasteredDataMiningScript PUBLIC" is a script created by Ox1gen1.

In order to use the script you need to use Unity AssetRipper

Tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiWSxHzj434
GitHub to AssetRipper: https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper

When using AssetRipper make sure to export all so you have all files you can get.
When you have exported all the size of "BattleBit" file (Asset Rippers output) should be over 7GB (Mine was 7.7GB)

Use Microsoft Visual Studio or whatever you want, copy the code from BattleBitRemasteredDataMiningScript PUBLIC.txt
Copy/Paste the code, write your MonoBehaviour, PrefabInstance and AnimationClip paths.
Execute code and it should work.
